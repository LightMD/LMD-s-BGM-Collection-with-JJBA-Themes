Thanks for downloading LightMD's BGM Collection with JJBA Themes.
If you have an idea what could be improved, write your it in the comment section of the mod's Gamebanana or forum page.

The mod must be put at C:\Users\Your Username\Appdata\Roaming\Sonic3AIR\Mods and then load it from the game itself. :)

Cheers!
